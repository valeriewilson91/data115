Data 115

The purpose of my analysis is to assess how the popularity of a video game genre varies by region.

The data comes from a web scrape of vgchartz.com and includes 16,598 video game sales. Only games with sales greater than 100,000 copies are included. I will be looking at the popularity of genres in five regions; North America, European Union, Japan, Other (remainder of the world), and Global.
